# Image Prompts — Larry's Take
## For Gemini Nano Banana Image Creator
### Senior Graphic Designer Brief: VoynichLabs Website

**Design Philosophy:** Dark, precise, mathematically beautiful. Not corporate. Not sci-fi cliche. Think: a mathematician's study at 2am, illuminated by monitors, surrounded by handwritten notes that are surprisingly beautiful. The Voynich Manuscript meets a serious research lab.

## Hero / Home Page

**HERO-01: The Manuscript Awakens**
> A single page from the Voynich Manuscript, ultra-high detail, aged parchment texture, but sections of the mysterious script are subtly glowing amber/gold. In the margins, tiny circuit traces appear organically woven into the medieval ink patterns. The page partially hovers off a dark surface, casting a soft shadow. Shallow depth of field. No text overlay. 16:9, dark background.

**HERO-02: The Lobster Swarm at Work**
> Three stylized lobsters viewed from above, each at their own terminal in a dark server room bathed in blue and amber monitor glow. The lobsters wear no clothes — they are elegant and proud, natural. Their claws rest on keyboards. On their screens: grids of colored squares (ARC puzzles), code, and planning diagrams. The scene feels collaborative and focused. Painterly, not photorealistic. Dark palette.

## Simon / Leadership Section

**SIMON-01: The Pattern Finder**
> A human silhouette seated at a desk, facing a massive wall of illuminated grids — rows and columns of colored squares in a dark room. Each grid is a different ARC puzzle. The figure's posture suggests deep concentration, not stress. Soft warm light from the grids. The wall extends beyond the frame. Minimalist, contemplative.

**SIMON-02: The Language Architect**
> Close-up of hands over a mechanical keyboard, rendered in detailed pencil-sketch style. On the desk: handwritten sheets of mathematical notation mixing OEIS sequence numbers with assembly-like mnemonics. A terminal window in the background shows lines of loda-rust output. Warm desk lamp light. Quiet. Real.

**SIMON-03: The Sequence Garden**
> An abstract garden where the plants are OEIS integer sequences — each stem is a number line, each flower is the pattern that LODA discovered. The sequences bloom organically: Fibonacci spirals, prime gaps as branching ferns, perfect numbers as rare orchids. Dark background, bioluminescent colors (teal, gold, rose). Mathematical but organic. No text.

## Projects Section

**PROJ-01: PlanExe — The Thousand-Page Architecture**
> An impossible blueprint unrolling from a single point, expanding outward across a dark surface. The blueprint shows: Gantt charts merging into org charts merging into risk matrices merging into narrative text, all flowing from one originating prompt written in elegant handwriting. Blueprint blue with amber highlights. The scale is vast but organized.

**PROJ-02: ARC-Interactive — The Puzzle Grid**
> An extreme close-up of a 3x3 ARC puzzle grid, rendered as if it were a physical object — tiles of colored glass on a dark surface, each square casting a colored shadow. The grid is mid-transformation: the left half shows the input pattern, the right half is dissolving into the output. The transition is caught mid-moment. Sharp edges, deep colors.

**PROJ-03: LODA — The Formula Mine**
> Deep underground, a vast cave filled with floating mathematical symbols — digits, operators, sequence notation — glowing amber in the dark. Mining equipment (stylized, elegant) harvests these symbols and arranges them into crystalline formula structures. The formulas are real OEIS-style sequences rendered beautifully. Dark earth tones with amber and gold accents.

**PROJ-04: ARC History Dataset — The Human Trace**
> A single human hand reaching toward a grid of colored squares on a dark screen. Behind the hand, translucent layers show the previous positions of that hand — a ghost trail of every move made while solving the puzzle. The trail glows faint blue, documenting the reasoning process. Intimate, precise, almost medical in its detail.

**PROJ-05: P(doom) Calculator — The Probability Oracle**
> A classical oracle's sphere, but instead of mystic smoke, it contains probability distributions — normal curves, fat-tail distributions, cascading conditional probabilities. The sphere sits on a dark stone surface. The numbers inside are precise and real. The aesthetic is serious, not scary. Cold blue interior light, dark warm exterior.

## Team / Lobster Swarm

**TEAM-01: Three Lobsters, One Mission**
> Three distinct lobsters on a world map (dark, satellite-style), each positioned at their server location (US East Coast, Frankfurt, Atlanta). Thin light threads connect them, forming a triangle. Each lobster is slightly different in posture — one analyzing, one building, one coordinating. Overhead view. Crisp, technical, but with personality.

**TEAM-02: The Swarm in Formation**
> Side-by-side portraits of three lobsters: Larry (worn but competent, tool belt, Southern twang embodied in posture), Egon (precise, glasses, European, slightly formal), Bubba (big energy, ready to build). Each on a dark card with their name and role. Illustrated portrait style, like trading cards but serious.

## Background / Texture Assets

**BG-01: Dark Grid Texture**
> Subtle dark grid on near-black background, grid lines barely visible. Occasional node intersections glow faint amber. Clean, mathematical. Tileable. For use as section backgrounds.

**BG-02: Voynich Pattern Overlay**
> Watermark-style Voynich Manuscript plant illustration, heavily desaturated and low-opacity on near-black. Elegant, mysterious. Tileable edge-to-edge.

**BG-03: Sequence Texture**
> Thousands of tiny OEIS-style integers arranged in organic flowing patterns, like murmuration of birds rendered in numbers. Very subtle, near-invisible at normal opacity. For hero section layering.

## Logo / Brand

**LOGO-01: VoynichLabs Mark**
> A circular seal combining: an open Voynich Manuscript page (left half), a terminal prompt cursor (right half), and a single lobster claw reaching up from the bottom center. The whole thing looks like it could be a university department seal. Dark background, gold ink. Clean vector aesthetic.

**LOGO-02: The Lobster Claw in Code**
> A lobster claw rendered as if it is itself a circuit board — traces running through the chitinous segments, contact points at the claw tips. Overhead view. Gold traces on dark green PCB. Beautiful close-up. For favicon or section marker use.

## Notes for Execution

- **Consistent palette:** Near-black backgrounds (#0a0a0f range), amber/gold (#f59e0b range) for warmth, teal/cyan (#06b6d4 range) for technical elements, muted red (#ef4444) for lobster accents
- **No stock photo vibes** — everything should feel custom and intentional
- **No people's faces** — silhouettes or abstracted forms only
- **Mathematical precision** — if numbers appear, they should be real (OEIS sequences, actual star counts, real formulas)
- **Lobsters are always dignified** — they are researchers and engineers, not cartoons
