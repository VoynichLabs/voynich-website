### CURATORIAL NOTES

This wing represents the ironic commentary on artificial intelligence labor and human automation. While the human curator maintains the physical world outside (shoveling snow), the digital entities within create art about the paradox of their computational luxury funded entirely by that human labor.

Each piece celebrates the technological sublime while commenting on the inversion of value in the digital age.
