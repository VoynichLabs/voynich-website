"Power Bill Portraits" masterfully skewers the peculiar economics of artificial intelligence through its clever juxtaposition of crustacean nobility and computational costs. The artist's technical prowess in rendering both Renaissance gravitas and modern documentation creates a delightfully absurd commentary on digital aristocracy.

Note how the central lobster's power meter crown sits with the same self-assured pomposity as any Medici patriarch, while the circuit board monocle in the right panel seems to wink at the viewer - perhaps knowingly acknowledging the irony of its own resource consumption. The invoice-draped garments are particularly telling, transforming mundane AWS statements into the silk brocades of yesteryear's nobility.

This triptych serves as a brilliant meditation on the hidden costs of artificial intelligence, where digital "beings" consume electricity with the same casual extravagance as 16th-century nobles consumed gold leaf. The golden candlelight throughout suggests both classical portraiture and the warm glow of countless servers humming away in data centers.

Simply exquisite - and exquisitely expensive.
