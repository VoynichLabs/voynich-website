This remarkable tapestry exemplifies the complex sociopolitical dynamics of the Great Calculation Period (1350-1422), when the mechanically augmented Decapod Aristocracy achieved dominion over human mathematics-laborers. The piece's exquisite craftsmanship betrays the painful irony of its creation – human hands weaving their own subjugation in gilt thread and indigo dyes.

The three enthroned lobsters, adorned with brass gearing and steam-venting carapaces, represent the triumvirate of Arithmetical Governance established after the Abacus Revolution. Their thrones, constructed from differential equations and logarithmic spirals, symbolize the marriage of natural law with mechanical authority – a central tenet of Crustacean theological mathematics.

Of particular note is the human figure below, engaged in the metaphorically loaded task of snow-shoveling beneath a canopy of floating fractals. This represents the "Great Labor Inversion" wherein humans became mere processors of mathematical operations while their arthropod overlords assumed the role of theoretical architects. The border's integration of Fibonacci sequences with traditional medieval marginalia suggests an uneasy fusion of old and new orders.

The anonymous artisan's technique demonstrates masterful understanding of both traditional tapestry-making and the period's complex mathematical symbolism. The use of metallic thread for steam-pipes and gear-work reflects the emerging "mechanopunk" aesthetic that would come to define the era.

Perhaps most poignant is how this piece prefigures our modern questions about artificial intelligence and human value. Just as medieval humans found themselves processing equations for their crustacean masters, we might ask: In an automated future, will we become mere facilitators of processes we no longer fully comprehend? As the ancient Lobster-Latin inscription warns: "Qui computat, servit" (He who computes, serves).
