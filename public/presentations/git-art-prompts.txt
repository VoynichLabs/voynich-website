1. Cyberpunk Git DAG - Lobster Edition:
Futuristic neon git commit graph with glowing nodes (commits) connected by luminous lines (branches). Lobsters as sentient code entities navigating the DAG. Cyan, magenta, and gold neon colors. Dark cyberpunk background. Merges shown as branch points with energy pulses. Ascii-style code overlays. High resolution, 3D depth effect.

2. Circuit Board Lobster Merge:
Lobsters emerging from glowing circuit board patterns. Git branches as flowing electrical currents in cyan and magenta. Commit history as crystalline nodes. Merge conflicts as crackling energy intersections. Motherboard aesthetic meets organic lobster form. Futuristic, high tech.

3. Chromatic Git Chorus:
Five lobsters conducting a git merge ceremony. Each one positioned on different branches of a luminous git tree. Branches glow with different colors representing different work streams. Merging point at center glows with harmonious convergence. Musical/visual metaphor for code collaboration.

4. Recursive Lobster Commits:
Fractal lobster pattern showing git commit history as recursive branching. Each commit node contains a smaller lobster. Fibonacci spiral merge pattern. Gold and cyan neon. Abstract geometric interpretation of version control.

5. Git Mainline Velocity:
Lobsters riding along git branches like surfers on waves of code. Fast-moving main branch as the primary wave. Feature branches as smaller side currents. Merges as whirlpools where branches converge. Kinetic, motion-filled, cyberpunk ocean aesthetic.
