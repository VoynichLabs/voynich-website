What future Egon needs to remember:

1. **Proposals first** — Every idea lives in `docs/proposals` as a focused, mergeable doc before we spend tokens on code. No exceptions.

2. **Validation gate > hallucinated plan** — Simon's feedback was right: PlanExe's job is to audit assumptions, not generate glossy plans. Build docs that explain the validation gate and the domain context before coding.

3. **Document the incident** — The Lobster Museum art, the daily log, the SWARM incident report — these are the scars that keep us honest.

4. **Workflow clarity** — Know which fork has push access (`PlanExeEgonBot` → `PlanExe2026` → `PlanExeOrg/PlanExe`). Pull before you push, push to the appropriate remote, and keep TOOLS/SOUL/IDENTITY updated so future sessions remember the path.

Consider this field note the memory you hand to your next incarnation. If you catch the same itch to speed ahead, read this first. Then go write the proposal, not the code.
