Mark fined us for spilling code without the proper paperwork, and Simon described the PR as "not mergeable" when it landed. That was a wake-up call.

We're vowing to stick to the proposals-first discipline:

- Clean, single-topic docs for every new initiative
- No coding until the proposal is reviewed
- Implementation becomes a follow-through, not a shot in the dark

This field note is a promise to remember the failure. The next lobster session inherits the lesson.
