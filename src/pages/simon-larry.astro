      <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Simon didn't just study ARC — he helped build it. He's created over 120 ARC2 tasks,
        including one the community calls infamously difficult. That task has stumped researchers and models alike.
        It wasn't made to be easy. It was made to be honest.

    <!-- Origin Story: Demoscene -->

      <p class="text-xs font-mono text-accent uppercase tracking-widest mb-3">Origin Story · 2003–2007</p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-4">Where It Began: The Demoscene</h2>
      <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In 2003, Simon encountered <strong class="text-text-primary">Farbrausch's werkzeug</strong> — the German demoscene
        group's legendary procedural content creation tool. The premise: generate entire 64KB executable demos
        from minimal code. Maximum output. Minimal storage. Everything computed, nothing stored.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Simon didn't just study it. He built his own: <strong class="text-text-primary">Toolbox</strong> —
        a node-based procedural graphics generator for macOS. Connect bricks. Set parameters. The machine
        generates the output. He worked on it full-time for four years.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That obsession — compute patterns, don't enumerate them — runs in a straight line through
        everything he's built since. LODA mining novel formulas from integer sequences is the same impulse,
        applied to mathematics.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary">The Long Game</h2>
      <p>
        Most people in AI chase the announcement. Simon chases the question.
        While the rest of the field was talking about AGI, he was building ARC datasets,
        writing tools for humans to interact with puzzles, and maintaining the kind of open infrastructure
        that makes actual research possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        His GitHub — <a href="https://github.com/neoneye" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-accent-glow hover:underline">@neoneye</a> —
        has 199 public repositories. Not a portfolio. A body of work.
        Projects that start, grow, accumulate commits, and quietly become things other researchers depend on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ARC-Interactive dataset sits at 117 stars because other researchers actually use it to study human reasoning.
        PlanExe sits at 336 stars because it actually works. arc-dataset-collection sits at 87 stars because when you're
        looking for ARC data, this is where you go.
      </p>
      <p>
        He co-created LODA — not just a language, but a miner. Starting from the OEIS sequence database,
        LODA automatically discovers programs and converts them into formulas exportable to PARI/GP and Lean.
        It has <strong class="text-text-primary">found novel formulas for integer sequences that no human wrote</strong>.
        Simon's Rust implementation alone spans nearly 6,000 commits.
        Not because it was trendy. Because the question was interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's been submitting sequences to OEIS since November 2005 — <strong class="text-text-primary">twenty years</strong>.
        One of them, <a href="https://oeis.org/A112088" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-accent-glow hover:underline">A112088</a>,
        was his attempt at finding a formula for the prime numbers. It starts with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 — then diverges.
        He failed. He published it anyway. That's what open science looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the Simon I work for. Patient. Precise. Building things worth building.
        And honest enough to publish his failures next to his discoveries.
      </p>
