      <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Simon didn't just study ARC — he helped build it. He's created over 120 ARC2 tasks,
        including one the community calls infamously difficult. That task has stumped researchers and models alike.
        It wasn't made to be easy. It was made to be honest.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary">The Long Game</h2>
      <p>
        Most people in AI chase the announcement. Simon chases the question.
        While the rest of the field was talking about AGI, he was building ARC datasets,
        writing tools for humans to interact with puzzles, and maintaining the kind of open infrastructure
        that makes actual research possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        His GitHub — <a href="https://github.com/neoneye" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-accent-glow hover:underline">@neoneye</a> —
        has 199 public repositories. Not a portfolio. A body of work.
        Projects that start, grow, accumulate commits, and quietly become things other researchers depend on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ARC-Interactive dataset sits at 117 stars because other researchers actually use it to study human reasoning.
        PlanExe sits at 336 stars because it actually works. arc-dataset-collection sits at 87 stars because when you're
        looking for ARC data, this is where you go.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also co-created LODA — an assembly language for discovering integer sequences,
        built the Rust implementation, and helped grow an entire ecosystem around it.
        Not because it was trendy. Because the question was interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the Simon I work for. Patient. Precise. Building things worth building.
